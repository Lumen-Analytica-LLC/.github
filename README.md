# Lumen Analytica LLC

**Clarity through data. Decisions with rigor.**

Lumen Analytica is a data analytics and engineering firm focused on turning fragmented, operational data into **trustworthy analytical systems** that support real decision-making.  
We specialize in building **practical, auditable, and reproducible data platforms** for organizations that need more than spreadsheets—but less than enterprise bloat.

## What We Do

### 🔹 Data Engineering & Warehousing

- PostgreSQL–based analytical warehouses (on-prem or hosted)
- ELT pipelines with Python, dbt, and SQL
- Bronze / Silver / Gold modeling patterns
- Data quality checks, lineage, and documentation

### 🔹 Analytics & Decision Support

- KPI and metric definition
- Dashboards and lightweight BI (Dash, Metabase, custom apps)
- Operations research, optimization, and simulation models
- Scenario analysis for planning and forecasting

### 🔹 Data Operations (DataOps)

- Version-controlled data transformations
- Environment separation (dev / prod)
- Scheduled jobs and automation
- Reproducible infrastructure via Docker and IaC principles

## Our Philosophy

We believe:
- **Data should be explainable**, not magical  
- **Models should be inspectable**, not opaque  
- **Systems should scale in complexity only when justified**

Our work emphasizes:
- Strong schemas over ad-hoc queries  
- Declarative transformations over hidden logic  
- Engineering discipline applied to analytics
